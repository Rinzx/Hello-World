# Hello-World
About to learn something new.

Am happy with this new phase of my life. I have been able to give up something that use to mean the world to me for a whole new pursuit. I am glad with thus far God has brought me on this journey. Presently, I am living out a dream. I will do my best to make the best of this new phase to build myself to the best I can be. So help me God. Amen.
